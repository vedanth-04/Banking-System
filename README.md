## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit lets you transform Python scripts into interactive web apps in minutes, instead of weeks. Build dashboards, generate reports, or create chat apps. Once youâ€™ve created an app, you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app.

### Why choose Streamlit?

- **Simple and Pythonic:** Write beautiful, easy-to-read code.
- **Fast, interactive prototyping:** Let others interact with your data and provide feedback quickly.
- **Live editing:** See your app update instantly as you edit your script.
- **Open-source and free:** Join a vibrant community and contribute to Streamlit's future.

- ## Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello
```

If this opens our sweet _Streamlit Hello_ app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to [our docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started) for specific installs.

The app features a bunch of examples of what you can do with Streamlit. Jump to the [quickstart](#quickstart) section to understand how that all works.

Create a new file `streamlit_app.py` with the following code:
```python
import streamlit as st
x = st.slider("Select a value")
st.write(x, "squared is", x * x)
```

Now run it to open the app!
```
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
